# Increasing order algorithm
Algorithm that asserts if removing a single element from an array of integers orders it by ascending values.

The solution is both in Kotlin and Swift programming languages, I resolved it first on a language I know (Kotlin) 
as I didn't had a clue about anythin in swift and then proceeded to write the solution in swift using the same steps
(or function equivalents) in swift, this pages were helpful in that:

- [Swift.org](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/TheBasics.html)
- [iSwift Cookbook](https://iswift.org/cookbook)
- [Online Swift playground](http://online.swiftplayground.run/)
- [Paiza.io online Swift playground](https://paiza.io/projects/daI-R5pMZXNUN0l27eUjGQ)

I made a flow diagram using [LucidChart](https://www.lucidchart.com) to exemplify better how this algorithm works:
